# Decentralized Facility Booking System (DApp)

This project is a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to book shared facilities (e.g., rooms, labs, spaces) through smart contracts on the blockchain. It consists of:

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel
- **Backend:** Built with Hardhat using Solidity smart contracts and deployed on Vercel

## Project Structure

```
/frontend/   - Next.js frontend for user interface (Deploy on Vercel)
